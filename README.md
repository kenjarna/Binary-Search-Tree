# Binary-Search Tree

Combining and executing these files will create a node (integer data values) binary-search tree that can insert, and determine
if the tree contains the search parameter. Additionally, this program will determine the height and size of the tree while also allowing
the user to show the preorder or inorder traversal of the tree. Additionally, the user can clear the tree, and see if the tree is 
empty. However, the program will run without user input, so the testing files are provided to determine whether the functions work
properly. The nodes for the tree are created using the "node1.cpp" and "node.h" files. These nodes are then used to create the binary-
search tree as described above.


The header files are written by Dr. Barbera Wahl and Dr. Theresa Wilson while the implementation and testing files are written
by Kenny Jarnagin, aspiring data scientist. 

Documentation of each test and function is provided in the individual test and implementation files.
